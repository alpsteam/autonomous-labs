# ðŸš€ Lab Zero: Provision your first Autonomous DB

Deploy your first Oracle Autonomous DB in less than five minutes.

### What is Oracle Autonomous DB?

With Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud services, you can develop and deploy on a preconfigured, **fully managed, and secured  environment** (database including services like Oracle APEX, Machine Learning notebooks, etc.) without any of the hassles of upkeep or manual maintenance.

Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and Autonomous Data Warehouse deliver self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database services that scale instantly to meet the demands of mission critical applications.

No IT skills required, meaning you don't need to be a database administrator, network engineer, security expert, or systems architect. Oracle takes care of it all, from configuration, tuning, backup, to patching, encryption, scaling and more, so that you can concentrate on solving business problems.

Oracle Autonomous DB comes in two flavors:
