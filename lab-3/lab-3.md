## Introduction to APEX and Autonomous DB

### What is Oracle APEX?

[Oracle Application Express (APEX)](https://apex.oracle.com/) is a low-code development platform that enables you to easily build enterprise apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere.

> **Build scalable, secure enterprise apps. Fast.**

Learning Oracle APEX is easy and it won't take long to pick up the basics. Check out the [learning section](https://apex.oracle.com/en/learn/) of APEX. For this lab, we don't require any prior experience with Oracle APEX.

### What is Oracle Autonomous DB?

With Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud services, you can develop and deploy on a preconfigured, **fully managed, and secured  environment** (database including services like Oracle APEX) without any of the hassles of upkeep or manual maintenance.

Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and Autonomous Data Warehouse deliver self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database services that scale instantly to meet the demands of mission critical applications.

No IT skills required, meaning you don't need to be a database administrator, network engineer, security expert, or systems architect. Oracle takes care of it all, from configuration, tuning, backup, to patching, encryption, scaling and more, so that you can concentrate on solving business problems.

## Step by Step Guide

Head to the [Oracle Cloud login page](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/sign-in) and enter your tenancy name.

From the hamburger menu in the top left, choose `Autonomous Transaction Processing`. The, create a database.

![Image3](images/image3.png)

Once done, choose the corresponding compartment.

![Image4](images/image4.png)

Choose a display name and database name for ATP instance.

![Image5](images/image5.png)

Keep the pre-selected options on ATP and choose `serverless`, number of OCPUs and storage as predefined.

![Image6](images/image6.png)

Choose a password with strong security for the database instance.

![Image7](images/image7.png)

Press `Create Autonomous Database`, this step takes approximately 3-5 minutes.
