# Autonomous Labs
[Lab 1: Swingbench and ATP](www.example.com) | [Lab 2: Analytics cloud](www.example.com) | [Lab 3: Low Code With APEX and Autonomous DB](www.example.com) | [Lab 4: Microservices and Autonomous DB](www.example.com) | [Lab 5: Some more labs](www.example.com)

Autonomous Labs are designed to get started instantly with Oracle Autonomous Database. All labs are hands-on and developers will build a small application to built upon. 

## Lab 4: Microservices (Helidon) with Oracle Autonomous DB

In this lab we will build a small RESTful API with a Helidon microservice. We will connect the microservice to Oracle Autonomous Transaction and deploy our application to Kubernetes using a CI/CD pipeline.

### Prerequisites

Here we can write about prerequisites.

- An Oracle Cloud Account
- Right permissions
- This lab will roughly require 200€ in Universal Cloud Credits
- etc.

### Introduction to Microservices

Here we can write about the technology and why its cool. E.g. what is APEX with some links and perhaps 1 or two screenshots.

## Lab guide

### Setting up repository

Divide the lab into 3-10 chapters. In each chapter describe all steps, including some screenshots.

### Wercker CI/CD pipeline
