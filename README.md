Autonomous Labs are designed to get started instantly with Oracle Autonomous Database. All labs are hands-on and developers will build a small application to built upon ðŸš€.

# Lab 4: Microservices (Helidon) with Oracle Autonomous DB

First we can provide a very short description with the purpose of the lab, like this: In this lab we will build a small RESTful API with a Helidon microservice. We will connect the microservice to Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and deploy our application to Kubernetes using a CI/CD pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Here we can write about prerequisites.

- An Oracle Cloud Account
- Right permissions
- This lab will roughly require 200â‚¬ in Universal Cloud Credits
- etc.

## Introduction to Microservices

Here we can write about the technology and why its cool. E.g. what is APEX with some links and perhaps 1 or two screenshots.

# Lab guide

## Setting up repository

This is where the tutorial starts with all steps of the lab. Divide the lab into 3-10 chapters. In each chapter describe all steps, including some screenshots.

## Wercker pipelines for Continous Integration

....

## Deploying to Kubernetes cluster

.....

## Some more steps

......

## Next steps

Here we can provide some next steps. We should give ideas what the lab participant can do next with the service. Oracle has lots of good resources (blogs etc.) thank we can link. 

## Issues

If there are issues with this lab guide or you have feedback please use the [issues section](https://github.com/m1nka/autonomous-labs-template/issues) of this repository.
