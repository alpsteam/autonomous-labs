## Getting started

### Dependencies

Just the Docs is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Just the Docs requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

### Quick start: Use as a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add Just the Docs to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` as a [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)
```yaml
remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs
```
<small>You must have GitHub Pages enabled on your repo, one or more Markdown files, and a `_config.yml` file. [See an example repository](https://github.com/pmarsceill/jtd-remote)</small>

### Local installation: Use the gem-based theme

1. Install the Ruby Gem
```bash
$ gem install just-the-docs
```
```yaml
# .. or add it to your your Jekyll siteâ€™s Gemfile
gem "just-the-docs"
```
2. Add Just the Docs to your Jekyll siteâ€™s `_config.yml`
```yaml
theme: "just-the-docs"
```
3. _Optional:_ Initialize search data (creates `search-data.json`)
```bash
$ bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init
```
3. Run you local Jekyll server
```bash
$ jekyll serve
```
```bash
# .. or if you're using a Gemfile (bundler)
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
4. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you're hosting your site on GitHub Pages, [set up GitHub Pages and Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) so that you can more easily work in your development environment.

### Configure Just the Docs

# ðŸš€ Autonomous Labs
[Lab 1: Swingbench and ATP](www.example.com) |Â [Lab 2: Analytics cloud](www.example.com) | [Lab 3: Low Code With APEX and Autonomous DB](www.example.com) | [Lab 4: Microservices and Autonomous DB](www.example.com) | [Lab 5: Some more labs](www.example.com)

Autonomous Labs are designed to get started instantly with Oracle Autonomous Database. All labs are hands-on and developers will build a small application to built upon.

# Lab 4: Microservices (Helidon) with Oracle Autonomous DB

> First we can provide a very short description with the purpose of the lab, like this: 

In this lab we will build a small RESTful API with a Helidon microservice. We will connect the microservice to Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing DB and deploy our application to Kubernetes using a CI/CD pipeline.

## Table of contents

> A table of contents which links to each section, like this: 

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Introduction to Microservices](#introduction-to-microservices)
* [Lab guide](#lab-guide)
   * [Setting up repository](#setting-up-repository)
   * [Wercker CI/CD pipelines](#wercker-pipelines-for-continous-integration)
   * [Deploying to Kubernetes cluster](#deploying-to-kubernetes-cluster)
   * [Some more steps](#some-more-steps)
* [Next steps](#next-steps)
* [Issues](#issues)


## Prerequisites

> Here we can write about prerequisites.

- An Oracle Cloud Account
- Right permissions
- This lab will roughly require 200â‚¬ in Universal Cloud Credits
- etc.

## Introduction to Microservices

> In this section we do an `Introduction to [topic]`.

Here we can write about the technology and why its cool. E.g. describe what is APEX, with some links and perhaps one or two screenshots. Or why are microservices popular and why should you do it with Helidon and Oracle Managed K8s.

If you want to include an image, the image should be in a folder `/images` and can be shown like this:

![Oracle DB with Microservices](/images/oracle-db-microservices.png)

# Lab guide

## Setting up repository

This is where the tutorial starts with all steps of the lab. Divide the lab into 3-10 chapters. In each chapter describe all steps, including some screenshots.

All lab resources, e.g. CSVs, code, etc. should be included in the repository.

## Wercker pipelines for Continous Integration

Should there be a need to highlight code it can be done like this.

```java

public class GreetService {
  @GET
  @Path("/greet")
  public String getMsg() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}

```

## Deploying to Kubernetes cluster

.....

## Some more steps

......

## Next steps

Here we can provide some next steps. We should give ideas what the lab participant can do next with the service. Oracle has lots of good resources (blogs etc.) thank we can link. 

## Issues

If there are issues with this lab guide or you have feedback please tell us in the [issues section](https://github.com/m1nka/autonomous-labs-template/issues) of this repository.
